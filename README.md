# Hi there, I'm Samuel Omotesho 👋

## 🔎 About My GitHub
You might notice my GitHub is still a work in progress—I've recently transitioned from Replit, where I had been coding since I was younger. Unfortunately, Replit wiped all my projects due to my free account status (unbelievable, right?), so like many in the industry, I’m making the move to GitHub. As I rebuild my portfolio here, expect to see more projects, tools, and cybersecurity-related experiments soon!
